# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): with Feature-Centric Approach

we’ll explore how to set up a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system where features are a central part. We'll go through defining modules, associating features, assigning roles with specific features, and finally assigning roles to users. This example uses JSON data to keep things simple and adaptable, **allowing for scalable access control without requiring any changes for new roles on the frontend**

## features

1. **Module-Feature Structure:** Group similar features into modules, such as "Users" and "Reports", for easier management and expansion.
2. **Feature Assignment:** Assign Feature to roles, defining which features each role can access (e.g., "view-users", "edit-reports").
3. **Flexible Role Management:** Easily add new roles, update permissions, or change user roles without modifying the frontend, allowing for scalable access control.
4. **Applications and Use Cases:** Ideal for admin dashboards, enterprise software, e-commerce, and educational platforms where structured access control is necessary.
